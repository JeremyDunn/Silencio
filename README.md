#VIA Starter Theme 

##Getting Started

This is a guideline for setting up the theme after deployment.

1. Check the /res/functions/viatheme-theme-options.php file. Configure or remove options as needed.
2. Open footer.php and make updates to reflect the changes made to Theme Options.
3. Configure the header.php file with any site-specific needs.
4. Design Staff adds typography.css, then converts it to LESS.
5. Add Variables to /res/less/layout.less and other LESS files.
